# Tests

## Purpose
The purpose of the tests are to help developers of PaperTTY. By running the tests you can (hopefully) verify that your changes did not cause any undesired side effects.

## Configuration
The tests were developed on a Raspberry Pi 400 and a 9.7 inch Waveshare screen with resolution 1200 Ã— 825. If you want to run the tests using another computer or another screen you probably will need to modify some parameters in the tests.

## Running the tests
Given that you have installed PaperTTY using Poetry, you can run the tests with
```bash
sudo poetry run pytest
```
